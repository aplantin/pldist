\usage{
pldist_all(otus, metadata, paired = FALSE, method = c("b", "g", "j",
  "k", "u"), tree = NULL, gam = c(0, 0.5, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{otus}{OTU count or frequency table, containing one row per sample and one column per OTU.}

\item{metadata}{Data frame with three columns: subject identifiers (n unique values, column name "subjID"), 
sample identifiers (must match row names of otu.tab, column name "sampID"), 
and time point or group identifier (if using longitudinal distances, this must be numeric or 
convertable to numeric).}

\item{paired}{Logical indicating whether to use the paired version of the metric (TRUE) or the 
longitudinal version (FALSE). Paired analyis is only possible when there are exactly 2 
unique time points/identifiers for each subject or pair.}

\item{method}{Desired distance metric(s). Include a vector with any combination of braycurtis,
jaccard, kulczynski, gower, and unifrac, or any unambiguous abbreviation thereof.}

\item{tree}{Rooted phylogenetic tree of R class "phylo". Default NULL; only needed for 
UniFrac family distances.}

\item{gam}{Parameter controlling weight on abundant lineages for UniFrac family distances. The 
same weight is used within a subject as between subjects. Default (0, 0.5, 1); only needed for 
UniFrac family distances.}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing all n x n distance (or dissimilarity) matrices requested, 
with both quantitative and qualitative versions of the metric, named as "D_metric_quant" or 
"D_metric_qual".
}
\description{
Function that calculates multiple paired and longitudinal ecological distance/dissimilarity 
matrices. Includes qualitative and quantitative versions of Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, Kulczynski, 
Gower, and unweighted and generalized UniFrac distances/dissimilarities. UniFrac-based 
metrics are based in part on GUniFrac (Jun Chen & Hongzhe Li (2012)). Both quantitative and 
qualitative versions of each requested metric are returned.
